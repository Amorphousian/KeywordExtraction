<br><div class='jobsearch-JobComponent-description icl-u-xs-mt--md'>WHO WE ARE
<br/><br/>
Zume is on a quest to be the most powerful source of health and well-being on the planet. We started by partnering people with technology to create a more thoughtful and efficient way to source, make, bake and deliver pizza. In the process, we are delivering an artisan pizza that takes care of the people who eat it and make it, and even takes better care of the planet we all love—a planet 9 billion people will inhabit by mid-century.
<br/><br/>
The health and well-being of people and our planet is dependent upon sustainably feeding that population with wholesome, affordable food on a global scale. Zume is meeting this challenge with an end-to-end, scalable platform that reduces the time and distance between clean food sources and dense population centers, using cutting-edge automation and transportation logistics. By developing better tools and processes, we can feed people healthier, sustainably-grown food, delivered fresh and free from chemical stabilization.
<br/><br/>
We have an employee-first philosophy and we're deeply committed to investing in the happiness, satisfaction and success of everyone we work with. We are looking for a team who feels the same way! Join us as we change the way people think about food.
<br/><br/>
THE ROLE
<br/><br/>
We're expanding our fleet of vehicles that can autonomously prepare food in-transit. We've proven that we can do it with Pizza now we're going to scale it to all prepared food.
<br/><br/>
The problem we need to solve is a combination of Uber's ride scheduling problem with Amazon's autonomous supply chain problem, but to make things more tricky food needs to show up freshly prepared, so timing is critical. And that just the tip of the iceberg of where we're going. To scale we're going to need to solve lot of really hard problems that call for a world class data science team. That's where you come in.
<br/><br/>
You should have a broad understanding of data science in general, but we're also looking for specialists in at least one of (convex) optimization, stochastic processes, time series, and machine learning. Graduate work in any of these fields is a plus. You'll need to be proficient in programming (python), and not afraid to get your hands dirty in implementation. Experience with hardware a plus, but not required.
<br/><br/>
This is a rare opportunity to get in at the early stages of a growing team, in a rapidly growing company. We're looking for one of the next leaders in the industry. If that's you, lets talk.
<br/><br/>
WHO YOU ARE
<br/><br/>
A generalist in data science with deeper experience in either Optimization, Stochastic Processes, Deep Learning or reinforcement learning.
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>Degree CS, Applied Math, Statistics, or other scientific field. Graduate degree a plus</li>
<li>Experience building models on real world problems</li>
<li>Software development experience in python</li>
</ul>
BONUS POINTS
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with hardware / robotics</li>
<li>Understanding of supply chains</li>
<li>Previous experience at a start-up</li>
</ul>
WHAT WE OFFER
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>100% company-paid Medical, Dental, and Vision for you and 75% for your dependents</li>
<li>Ownership via Stock Options</li>
<li>Flexible Time Off</li>

<p>TransLoc’s mission is to help riders on public transportation reach their jobs and schools in the most equitable, accessible, informative and optimized way ever. Unlike other technology companies, we believe that public transit is central to the future of mobility and our products help agencies by bridging the chasm between today’s needs and tomorrow’s demands. Are you aligned with our mission and values? We want to hear from you!</p>
<p><b>What are we looking for?</b></p>
<p>We’re looking for someone who will be the customer-facing data expert to our microtransit agency partners. As a member of our data science focused team, you will be our embedded representative on the cross-functional microtransit implementation team, working hand-in-hand with transit agencies to launch successful microtransit services. You will be responsible for applying our data and simulation tools to each agency’s specific needs, in the process helping them make data-driven decisions about how to design their demand-response services. You can expect your days to be filled with customer conversations, wrangling data, running simulations with our established tools, and presenting results to agencies. You will be on the front lines of learning about microtransit alongside transit agencies, and will help us continue to develop our tools to innovate with data.</p>
<p><b>Are you...</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Equally excited by talking with customers and analyzing data.</b> This is a unique data science position that requires being comfortable communicating with a variety of non-quants in real-time conversation about data results and transit service design, as well as focusing in on data analysis and report creation.</li>
<li><b>A natural collaborator. </b>You will work as part of a cross-functional team of data scientists, engineers, and project managers, as well as across the organization and with our transit agency partners.</li>
<li><b>Comfortable with ambiguity. </b>We’re doing new things, and we have guidelines but no right answers. You’ll need to be able to make decisions with limited information and keep up with rapidly changing context.</li>
<li><b>Independently motivated.</b> You thrive in a work environment where freedom comes with the responsibility to hold yourself accountable to high standards.</li>
<li><b>Mission driven. </b>If seeing new transit services come to life and serve riders in new ways is profoundly satisfying to you, everything else is likely to fall into place.</li>
</ul><p><b>You should have...</b></p>
<ul><li>At least 3 years post-graduate applied experience.</li>
<li>A Bachelor's degree in urban planning or related field, OR a degree in a data-related discipline with applied experience in transit or urban planning. A Master’s degree is preferred, but not required.</li>
<li>Experience in transit or urban planning, with an emphasis on working with data. Experience with the innovative application of technology is a plus.</li>
<li>Some experience programming with data using R or Python, with a willingness to use R primarily.</li>
</ul><p><b>Pay &amp; More:</b></p>

<br/><br/>
At Carvana, we sell cars, but we're not salespeople. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way. To fix that, we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a 'T'). We provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers from A-to-Z. From acquiring, inspecting and certifying high quality cars, to providing 360° high-resolution photography inside and outside of the vehicle, to generating real-time financing and warranty options, to providing consumers with the option to have cars delivered to their driveway in as little as 24 hours or pick-up from one of our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machines (yes, you read that right) all with a 7-day Money Back Guarantee, we've made it our mission to redefine the car buying status quo. With no dealerships or commissioned salespeople, we also save thousands of dollars per car in expenses that we pass on to our customers.
<br/><br/>
Recently named Forbes' 5th Most Promising Company in the U.S., we offer the excitement, culture, and opportunity of a start-up, with the capitalization and infrastructure of a much more established business.

<br><div class='jobsearch-JobComponent-description icl-u-xs-mt--md'><div><p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>At Hometap, we believe you can have a house and a life. In fact, for many, having a house is the key to having a life. By tapping into the built-in value of a home, we help homeowners do the big-ticket stuff that makes life better: Start a business or buy a second home without taking out additional debt to pay for it. Get out from under crippling debt without ruining credit. And when it comes to college tuition, parents can help their children secure their future without sacrificing their own.</p>
<p>Hometap makes investments in residential homes, buying a small equity stake against the home’s future value. For homeowners, this is a simplified, sensible alternative to mortgage debt and monthly payments. For investors, this is a new asset class, allowing them to participate in the multi-trillion-dollar residential real estate market without the obligations and downsides of homeownership.</p>
<p><b>Who You Are</b></p>
<p>Data drives you. You are motivated by having a significant impact on the company and creating differentiated solutions within this brand-new industry. You are comfortable exploring and working your way through ambiguity. You value collaborating with a team of researchers who encourage your success.</p>
<p><b>What We’re Looking For</b></p>
<p>HomeTap is seeking a Data Scientist to join us at the ground level to build a world class data and analytics platform. This driven data scientist will have the opportunity to work with our experienced Leadership team to build the data platform from the ground floor. We are at the forefront of a brand new, multi-trillion dollar industry, and use large-scale data analysis to help homeowners unlock their equity. This role will have significant impact developing the algorithms necessary to accurately value home prices, forecast home value appreciation and help drive investment decision-making.</p>
<p><b>What You Bring</b></p>
<ul><li>Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science, data science, information technology, economics, statistics, the hard sciences, or related fields.</li>
<li>3+ years experience in several of the following:</li>
<li>Python Data Science analyst package such as NumPy, scikit-learn, Pandas, XGBoost, etc.</li>
<li>Processing frameworks such as Spark, or similar</li>
<li>Significant experience building models, algorithms and data structures for machine learning</li>
<li>Statistical analysis methodologies</li>
<li>Ideally, visualization experience with packages such as matplotlib, plot.ly, &amp; Tableau</li>
<li>SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL, Snowflake, et al.</li>
<li>Source code management experience with Git, et al.</li>
<li>Demonstrable ability to analyze large data sets and provide compelling insights to technical and non-technical people</li>
</ul><p><b>Our Team &amp; Culture</b></p>
<p>At Hometap, the Data Science team is the research and development department of the company. We build industry leading solutions which create significant competitive advantage for the company. Some of the problems we face have very amorphous scopes and require the team to embrace an experimentation and cooperation mindset. As such we rely on each other’s varying expertise to scope the problem into manageable, tractable, goals. Collaboration is a central tenet of the group, we plan together, execute independently and share with each other throughout the project. Therefore we value openness, transparency and accept the best idea, wherever it originates from.</p>
<p>Equally important to the candidate’s skill-sets is the candidate’s fit within our business. We are looking for someone who is entrepreneurial, fast paced, data-driven, a creative thinker who looks for opportunities within challenges, has a competitive drive to win and values collaboration.</p>

<br><div class='jobsearch-JobComponent-description icl-u-xs-mt--md'><div><h2 class='jobSectionHeader'><b>Overview
</b></h2><div><div><div><div><b>Who We Are</b></div><div>
NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. It’s our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (you’ve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.</div><br/>
<div>
We’re probably a little more Valley than Beltway. Culture first. Service oriented, non-hierarchical, focused on the work, and less about process/ dress codes/ etc. We believe in giving back, too. For example, our founder leads a company trip every year to the Dominican Republic to build homes as part of Homes of Hope.</div>
</div></div></div><h2 class='jobSectionHeader'><b>Responsibilities
</b></h2><div><div><div><div><b>Why We’re Both Here - The Work at Hand</b></div><div>
One of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team. You’ll be an expert for clients, partnering closely with our team of Developers and Data Engineers to create robust machine learning solutions. You’ll bring your skills to bear to solve complex problems, provide guidance on current and emerging technologies, and drive the future of our data science enterprise. We mostly focus on exploiting geospatial data of all types (because pictures and maps are fun!) with a sprinkling of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We’ve also got some really cool technology partners that add tools to your toolkit.</div><br/>
<div>
We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).</div>
</div></div></div><h2 class='jobSectionHeader'><b>Qualifications
</b></h2><div><div><div><div><b>Who You Are</b></div><div>
Beyond the whole “this person is awesome and I love working with them” piece, there are a few core skills that will help you out here.
</div><ul><li>Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.</li><li>
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data.</li><li>
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
</li><li>Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.</li><li>
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics. We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.
</div></div><div>People issue over 2 billion searches on Facebook every day to find people, pages, videos, and connect with the communities and interests that matter to them. Facebook Search team is working to build a global, general-purpose search engine that leverages the unique content and social connections on Facebook. By unlocking the unique information and connections available on Facebook, we believe we can provide a more meaningful experience for people around the world, especially in mobile-first countries. To achieve our goal, we need to solve some of the most challenging engineering problems in the industry, across areas such as Infrastructure, Product, Mobile, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
<br/>
Being a complex engineering system, Facebook Search depends on several machine learning models and heavy natural language processing. Understanding the user's search intent from their search query is crucial to retrieving and matching the right content from Facebook's vast amount of social data. NLP team focuses on developing various machine learning technologies to process and transform a search query into a form that is utilized by the subsequent systems for retrieval and ranking. Context of the search query and its implicit and explicit semantics play an important role in satisfying the searcher's information need. Similar technologies are utilized to decipher the meaning and intent of the content in Facebook to create the matching between user intent and content.
<br/>
A Data Scientist in this role will leverage his knowledge and understanding of these technologies along with the vast and powerful search dataset in order to: (1) provide tactical engineering systems development guidance by bridging lower level NLP system components' performance to higher level product performance (2) perform various forms of opportunity analyses to influence NLP systems development roadmap and (3) collaborate with software engineers to help develop better ways of understanding search queries and content on Facebook. This is a key role within the greater search team and it requires heavy involvement with technical aspects of the core search technology. Join us, if you like getting involved in the details, think big and want to take Facebook Search to the next level!</div><div><div>

<br><div class='jobsearch-JobComponent-description icl-u-xs-mt--md'><div><div><p>Data science is the core around which Custora is built. The central value proposition of our product is that we provide e-commerce businesses the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with</li>
<li>analyze it for patterns and predictions</li>
<li>deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way</li>
<li>and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door</li>
</ul><p>The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.</p>
<p>
We place particular emphasis on providing a robust <i>system</i> of statistical insights. Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation’s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn’t even thought of.</p>
<p>
On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we’ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we’re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.
</p><p><b>Specifically, we are looking for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.</li>
<li>Experience with at least two programming languages and one general-purpose statistical package or programming library. The data science team mainly uses R, Scala, and Ruby, but that’s not set in stone, and we value the ability to learn new libraries and ecosystems.
</li><li>Friendly and ready to work with others, both technical and non-technical. We don’t work in isolation and regularly interact with each other and members of other teams.
</li><li>At least some familiarity with: Unix-like operating systems, SQL databases, and web application programming. Strong experience in any is a plus.
</li><li>Other pluses: experience with distributed-computing ecosystems like Spark; experience with Amazon Web Services; experience teaching statistics or programming</li>
</ul><br/>
<p><b>What</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>here:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>On Monday we eat and meet as a team to chat projects and progress.</li>
<li>We’re 45 genuinely nice people. We work together and experiment with how to do things. It’s an amazing environment to both explore your professional interests and shape your career trajectory.</li>
<li>We move quickly. You build something and the next day it comes to life. You see and feel an immediate impact with the collective efforts of the team.</li>

<p>Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications.

<p>Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.
</div></div><div><br/>
At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community; the mission of the Sharing Organization at Facebook is to do just that. The Sharing Ecosystem team’s job is to step back, and tackle deep, challenging questions that'll help inform our understanding of sharing on Facebook and the barriers. Questions like: what’s driving the sharing decline on Facebook, how much of this is from competition, from increasing audience concerns, from politicization of Facebook and changes in sentiment and brand; how do we use our understanding of sharing drivers to make accurate, non-linear forecasts; we know women and children are most susceptible to harassment and bullying - how does this impact their propensity to share, how do we detect and mitigate this in the future? This team is unique in that it’s not directly tied to a product team, which provides the team with the space to dive deep into these topics. The ideal candidate is someone who is a deep systems thinker, and is someone who is looking for a role that is more research heavy.

Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company. EA delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>
Data Scientist, EA Customer Experience</p>
<p>#WeAreEA and we exist to inspire the world to play. EA values creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork. We mean things like acting with curiosity, speaking up with original ideas, and committing to each other as one team.</p>
<p>
We’re looking for all the best kinds of people to make great experiences for our players. The best people want a job that inspires them, while giving them room to enjoy their lives. And we want to give them that. We celebrate diversity and inclusion by creating a place where you can come to work and be yourself.</p>
<p>
You’re a Data Scientist.
</p><br/>
<p>You know how to pull all types of data from any source, be it Facebook posts, call center chats, video likes or survey results. You understand that you have 2 basic jobs:</p>
<p>
Help our studios understand what problems players have with their games and provide insights that help optimize our call center. Both pursue the ultimate goal of providing the World’s Best Service for the World’s Best Games.</p>
<p>
You use all resources available to you to help solve a problem, be it a new algorithm, programming language or the person sitting next to you.</p>
<p>
You’re a programmer/statistician/NLP expert who is fanatic about games and Customer Experiences.</p>
<p>
You’re also a genuinely nice person who brings positive energy to an office. You’re approachable and take the time to listen so that you understand someone else’s view.</p>
<p>
This role is part of EA’s Customer Experience organization. The Customer Experience organization strives to make EA known for taking care of its players. We’re players taking care of players and people talking to people – whenever, wherever, and however they need us.</p>
<p>
We’re the Data Science team, part of the larger Customer Experience Insights team.</p>
<p>We are surrounded by Production, BI, SEO and Market Research analysts. We’re the people who use advanced statistics and modeling to help solve business problems. We surface player problems through our text analytics offerings. We write a lot of code and talk to stakeholders from all teams and all levels. We are great team mates and trusted advisors, who provide insights to facilitate decisions and create models that change experiences.</p>
<p>
A typical day in the life of a Data Scientist:</p>
<ul><li>Come into the office and catch up with your team mates about last night’s gaming session or the hottest show on TV (no spoilers until 24hrs have passed – after that: anything is fair game!)</li><li>
Check on last night’s Jenkins script and add some code to a project you’re working on</li><li>
Talk to one of your coworkers on the Call Center side about how to match the right advisor to the right player – this could be your next big project</li><li>
Take some time back at your desk to write up any notes and make a project plan proposal</li><li>
Attend a JIRA prioritization meeting to update work that’s in flight and plan for work to come</li><li>
Grab coffee and read up on any stats blogs or tech news you’re subscribed to</li><li>
Check out the model you deployed into production last month to see if it’s time to re-train</li><li>
Pull the latest changes on an NLP model you’re collaborating on from Stash and tinker with the parameters, then chat with your peer about the results of the tweaks and make plans for what to change next</li><li>
Spend a couple of hours heads down/headphones on getting series with an analysis.</li><li>
Finish the day looking over any code you wrote today, knit any Markdowns and make sure your documentation is up to snuff.</li></ul>
<p>So how do Data Scientists make great experiences for players? They:</p>
<ul><li>
Tell stories with data and interpret results for their stakeholders</li><li>
Prioritize problems to solve based on the impact to the player experience while keeping overall organizational goals in mind</li><li>
Have a basic understanding of EA’s games and find time to play whenever they can</li><li>
Display confidence in communicating with senior management, or any audience, to ensure what they say is heard and understood</li><li>
Identify and lead collaborative efforts both inside and outside of their team; working with key influencers to effect change</li><li>
Tailor communications to their audience, providing either in-depth expertise or a high-level summary depending on the situation</li><li>
Use models and techniques that win on performance and understandability vs. sophistication</li></ul>
<p>You’ll need to be awesome at wearing these hats:</p>
<p><i>
Customer Advocate</i> – You care what kind of experience our players are having when their games or services don’t work and you want to be an active participant in improving it</p>
<p><i>
Programmer</i> – You’re an expert at writing functions and identifying the right language for the right situation</p>
<p><i>
People Analyst</i> – You understand that your work contributes to improving people’s lives not predict when a machine is going to break down</p>
<p><i>
Learner</i> – You are a regular on Stack Overflow, know how to take apart a Vignette and are always looking for a new project that allows you to put that cutting edge technique to good use you read about last month</p>
<p><i>
Documentation Expert</i> – you know just the right level of documentation to help yourself and the next person understand what you did, when and why</p>
<p><i>
Teacher</i> – you’re patient and can field questions from the rest of the team around better coding practices</p>
<p><i>
Experiment Designer</i> – You can create up an A/B test in your sleep, but you don’t let a less than ideal A/B test set up stop you from finding some answers</p>
<p><i>
NLP fanatic</i> – you can turn language into math??? Yeah – that’s the stuff you love!</p>
<p>
A few last things about how we work, because they’re super important:</p>
<ul><li>We chat to each other in Slack</li><li>
We email each other about things that can wait or are just FYI</li><li>
We store all our code on Stash, how-to’s on Confluence and complete analyses on the Knowledge Repo</li><li>
We document our code like we’re going to win the lottery tomorrow and somebody else has to take over</li><li>
We plan and track our work in JIRA so we can avoid duplication with other teams</li><li>
We collaborate with Data Science at HQ to share best practices and exchange findings</li></ul>
<br/>
<p>If you’re interested in this role, you’ll need these skills or experiences:</p>
<ul><li>3 to 5 years’ experience in Data Science with focus on NLP</li><li>
Master’s in Computer Science, Statistics, Operations Research or related field (we will consider a Bachelor’s degree with significant relevant experience)</li><li>
Expert in at least one Statistical Programming Language such as R or Python</li><li>
Experience with relational and distributed databases</li><li>
Experience with any of the following is a big plus: PySpark, Scala, Zepplin Notebooks, Spark and MLlib as well as application development using AWS, Virtual Machines, or Docker</li><li>
Gaming industry and customer support experience a plus</li></ul>
<p>What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!
</p><p>We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality. At EA, we live the “work hard/play hard” credo every day. More about our location:</p>

Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

<li>We hope the outcome of your contributions will offer true dashboards resulting from data consolidation from the variety of sources that we have driving the Retail vertical forward into the 21st century.

<p>
As part of our work, Murmuration has developed a technology product called “m{insights” that seeks to aggregate data from a combination of sources including member data from partner organizations, publicly available data, consumer data, voter file data, and more.

We are looking for a creative and endlessly inquisitive Data Scientist to join our team.

<li>Produce post-mortem analytics on the advocacy and campaign work being performed in our platform to help our partners constantly learn from their efforts</li>
<li>Conduct various analyses to infer causality from large sets of behavioral data</li>
<li>Work closely with the data engineering team to analyze and augment our data</li>
<li>Work closely with our business analysts to draft clear and informative data visualizations</li>
<li>Work with our staff and partners to develop practical ways to apply our leading analytics to the real world</li>
<li>Help optimize our analytic work to perform well on large datasets stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
<li>Never stop asking questions and always be hunting for the next impactful insight</li>
</ul><p><b>Candidate Profile</b></p>

We revolutionized e-commerce with features such as 'Customers Who Bought This Also Bought' and 'Recommended for You,' and we continue to be at the forefront of innovation in this space. We rely heavily on experimentation for learning how best to serve our customers: when we launch something new, how do we know it's actually effective and makes the customer experience better, not worse?

You challenge yourself and others to come up with better solutions. You develop strong working relationships and thrive in a collaborative and friendly team environment.<br/>

About us together:<br/>
<br/>
We're going to help Amazon innovate faster and smarter by designing and delivering the next generation of data analysis tools and visualizations. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly insurmountable challenges.

We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.<br/>
<br/>
We have decades of combined experience on the team in many areas of data science so it's a great environment in which to learn and grow. Many of us have university teaching experience and we're happy to teach. But, we're also like children playing at the edge of a vast unexplored territory; we have a lot to learn and we are all exploring together with a sense of awe and humility.<br/>

<br/>Create the model that transforms an industry
<br/>********************************************
<br/><br/>
Want to bring a $15B sector of the insurance industry into the 21st century? Yearning for a startup built around machine learning? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.
<br/><br/>
Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs title insurance. The current incumbents pay only 5% of their intake as claims; they spend about 85% running a manual process that involves frequent paper searches and phone calls for millions of mortgages every year.
<br/><br/>
States Title is modernizing this antiquated process and will scale rapidly to grab a large fraction of the market. By bringing data science to title insurance, we can repurpose those wasted billions towards making homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.
<br/><br/>
*************************************************
<br/>We're growing our data science team at all levels
<br/>*************************************************
<br/><br/>
As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun, diverse, and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at The White House, Google, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.
<br/><br/>
We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.
<br/><br/>
**************************
<br/>Do you have what it takes?
<br/>**************************
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>2-10 years of relevant experience in any of the following:</li>
<li>Fintech: you've built credit risk, fraud, or insurance models or algorithms and worked with engineering teams to deploy them</li>
<li>Academia: you've used real-world data to publish highly cited peer-reviewed journal articles on prediction or inference using open source tools</li>
<li>Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models</li>
<li>Strengths aligned with our needs</li>
<li>Theoretical background relevant to data science (e.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?)</li>
<li>Technical skills (e.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?)</li>
<li>Creative skills (e.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?)</li>
<li>Collaboration skills (e.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?)</li>
<li>In-person, full-time availability</li>
<li>You live in or are willing to relocate to the SF Bay Area</li>
<li>You thrive on in-person interaction and look forward to getting in to work</li>
